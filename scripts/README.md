This directory will contain all our scripts, either in python or R. They will be in a number of different formtats: 
* .ipynb (both Python and R)
* .py (Python)
* .Rmd (mainly for R)
* .txt (R scripts)
* ...

We will have to develop a consitent naming habit, like "programminglanguage_TASK_description-of-the-task.fileformat".
